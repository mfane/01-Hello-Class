If you want more detailed instructions, here are the steps to follow:

1. Log into your account on [github.com](github.com)
2. Go to the [assignment template page](https://github.com/ILS-Z399/01-Hello-Class) on GitHub
3. There is a button in the top right corner of the page labeled "Fork". Press that now
4. A modal window will appear asking you where you want to fork the repository. Select your account. This will create an independent copy of this repository in your account that you can begin to edit
5. Go to your GitHub home page, and select the new 01-Hello-Class repository
6. On that page, you will see a green button labeled "Clone or download". Press that now. This will give you the option to "Open in Desktop"; that's the option you want to select
7. If you have previously installed the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), that will now open and ask you where you want to clone this repository. This is the process of saving a copy of the code on your local computer. On Windows, the default is something like c:\Users\(username)\Documents\Github\01-Hello-Class
8. Once GitHub Desktop has cloned (downloaded) the code, it will be responsible for keeping the code on your local computer synchronized with the repository in your GitHub account. You can now open the folder where you cloned the code in your IDE of choice (pycharm, etc)
9. First, edit the file called LICENSE. Replace the [year] [fullname] with the current year and your name (e.g., 2018 Jason Francis). Save this file
10. Then edit the file called 01 hello.py. This is the python code for this assignment. Replace the line "print('Hello, Class!')" with a line that answers the first question for the assignment (e.g., "print('Hello, my name is Jason Francis;)")
11. Add additional lines to answer the other questions from the list above. Be creative and descriptive, but remember that this information will be publically available. When you are done, save the file
12. You should test your code by running it in the python interpreter. You can do this from the command line (in Windows, click Start, click Run, type cmd and navigate to the folder where your repository is located, then type "python 01\ hello.py") or run it inside your IDE (if that is possible). Make sure everything looks the way you would expect
13. Open the README.md file (which, at this point contains all this information). The purpose of this file is to describe what you code does, so edit it to describe what you are trying to accomplish with your code. Write in your own voice, and try to be helpful to anyone who downloads this project. What are you hoping to accomplish? What should someone expect to see when they run your code? When you are done editing README.md, save the file
14. When you are done editing the files, go back to the GitHub Desktop. In the left column, you should see a list of the three files you edited with an indicator that they have been changed. At the bottom of the column, there is a field (labeled "Summary") for you to describe the changes you have made. Describe what you have done. GitHub convention suggests that you should use the present-tense, imperative: something like "Personalizes LICENSE and README.md and answers the required questions." Push the "Commit to master" button. This makes your changes an official part of the repository
15. In the top right corner of the GitHub Desktop window is a button that should now be labeled "Push origin". This will copy your changes to the GitHub repository
16. Check out your page on GitHub. You should see the changes you made reflected there, Repeat steps 9 through 16 as necessary
17. When you are satisfied with your efforts, turn in a URL to your repository on Canvas
